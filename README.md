# Generative adversarial networks (GANs) 

It provide the luxury of creating another type of image from the existing one.In this repository we have explored DCGAN and CycleGAN on MNIST dataset

- DCGAN was used to detect fake image generated by the Generator and the inputs from discrimator was used by the Generator to improve its image generation
- CycleGAN was used for generation of another image from the current one. We have used U-net architecture in this process
